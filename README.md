# Fighter_Planes
#The following images show the damage (indicated by the red dots) on aircrafts that returned from a mission. Create clusters of data by splitting the plane into regions and compare the damage in each cluster using a bar graph to determine where reinforcements need to be applied to the planes.

#Now consider the following 5 planes found in the ocean. Revisit your process and create another bar graph for these 5 planes.

#What conclusions can we draw from your analysis? Where should the plane be reinforced so that more planes return from missions? Was there a relationship between the total damage and planes returning?

#The middle part should be reinforced. This is where the most damage was found on planes in the ocean. I don't see a relationship between the total damage and planes returning.

#Planes that had minimal front damage and middle damage were able to return.
